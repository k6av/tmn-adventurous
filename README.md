# TMN "Adventurous" for Minecraft Forge 1.20.1
TMN "_Adventurous_" is a Forge modpack for 1.20.1 that incorporates "tech", "magic", and "nature" mods, provided by Mekanism (+ Railcraft Reborn), Apotheosis, and Biomes o' Plenty (+ Serene Seasons and Farmer's Delight) respectively. Additionally, it includes a few "must-have" utility mods including JEI, JourneyMap, OptiFine, and Jade (a successor to WAILA).

## Installation (Linux)
TMN can be installed with the install script:
```shell
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/k6av/tmn-adventurous/raw/main/install.sh" | bash
```

If your Minecraft installation folder is located somewhere other than `~/.minecraft`, you can use
```shell
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/k6av/tmn-adventurous/raw/main/install.sh" | MCDIR="/some/directory" bash
```

## No chat reports
This modpack includes a mod that disables the chat reporting system (both client-side and server-side, if installed). The Minecraft chat reporting system is flawed both technically and organisationally; to protect players from abuse this pack includes the "No Chat Reports" mod.
